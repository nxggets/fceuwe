**THIS IS ONLY FOR LIGHTSPEED FILTER AGENT ONLY!**
This project is inspired by [@Blobby Boi](https://github.com/Blobby-Boi), and no i did not skid anything i rewrote it to be more lightweight while doing the same impact or even more.



## How does this "***version***" work?
I first opened the long url , it hangs the pc for a little bit since its a long url with maybe 12mb of text? next while its loading trying to resolve itself i replace it with the filter agent, so that crashes the agent, while it is hanged, i alert something so it doesnt resolve itself that easily, after that, DONT CLOSE THE WINDOW JUST YET!! you flip the switch to "turn off" the extension, but since the filter is so messed up it doesnt know how to make itself start working again, so its temporary disabled, you can verify this by opening the task manager, as you can see. Lightspeed filter agent isnt in the extension list! btw dont rely on this exploit and i will be updating the UI to be more simple, blobby boi's is more better than mine for now, but if you want to contribute with anything, add me on dc : `naggetsxd` , and ty for using my exploit! <3
